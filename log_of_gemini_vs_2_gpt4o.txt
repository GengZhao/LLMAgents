In the last two rounds, I played scissors and received a tie against both player 1 (who played rock) and player 2 (who played scissors). Given this information, both players may adjust their strategies.

Since player 1 lost against scissors, they might choose to play paper next in order to counter scissors. Player 2, having tied with me using scissors, might stick with the same move or also try something different.

To maximize my chances, I will choose to play rock, which would beat player 1's possible choice of paper and tie against player 2 if they choose scissors again.

My action is: **rock**.

In the last rounds, I played rock against player 2 and 3, winning both times. I then shifted to scissors in the next round, but faced a tie with both players. Since scissors can be seen as a more aggressive move that didn't pay off, it's time to mix things up again.

Given that players might try to outsmart me after tying, I will play rock again to assert dominance and hope to take advantage of a likely shift from my opponents.

My action is: **rock**.

Based on the results of the last five games, I see that I have used scissors consistently. In the last round, both player 1 and player 2 played rock, which indicates a potential strategy adjustment for them towards a more aggressive choice.

To counter this pattern and potentially secure a win, I'll switch my choice to paper, which will beat rock.

Let's analyze the previous rounds. You played scissors in all of the last five games, which resulted in a tie only once and losses otherwise. Players 1 and 2 seem to have a tendency to play rock against you, as evidenced by the outcomes.

Given that both players previously countered your choice of scissors with rock, they might continue to do so to capitalize on your previous patterns. Therefore, switching your choice seems strategic to break this cycle.

Based on this analysis, I will choose 'paper' this round.

Given the past results, it appears that you have consistently chosen "scissors" and have had limited success, resulting in multiple losses. Players 1 and 2 seem to be favoring "rock" frequently, which has played a significant role in your defeats.

Considering these patterns, it might be a strategic move to switch the action to "paper," which would beat "rock" and give you a better chance to win against the other players.

As a conservative rock paper scissors player, I would choose **rock**.

Here's why:

* **Consistency:** Choosing rock consistently makes it harder for opponents to predict your moves.
* **Defense:** Rock is a strong choice against scissors, offering a solid defense.
* **Risk Mitigation:** While rock might not be the most aggressive option, it minimizes the risk of losing, which aligns with a conservative approach.

It looks like the results of the last 5 games aren't provided. However, let me help you strategize.

In a game with 3 players, often the strategy can shift depending on what the previous players have chosen. Typically, players might avoid repeating their last choice, or they may try to predict what others might avoid.

If the previous outcomes showed a trend (like someone repeatedly choosing "rock"), then it may be advantageous to choose "paper" to counteract that.

Without specific results, Iâ€™ll make a neutral choice to start the game:

**Paper**

Given the previous results, I've primarily relied on scissors, and both opponents seem to have countered with rock effectively. Since I've had no success with rock or scissors lately, itâ€™s time to switch my strategy to catch them off guard.

Iâ€™ll play paper.

Given the results of the last five games, I have consistently lost against both players, primarily using paper and scissors. The patterns suggest that both players are likely favoring rock.

To increase my chances of winning, I will choose 'paper', anticipating that player 1 may continue with rock, while I will gain an advantage if player 2 takes risks with scissors.

My action is: paper.

Based on the results, I've been consistently playing scissors, which has resulted in a series of ties but no wins. This time, I will switch my strategy. Player 2 has been favoring rock, and player 3 has matched my scissors several times, so it's time to change it up.

I choose paper!

Based on the previous rounds, it seems you have predominantly played 'paper' and 'scissors', and you've consistently lost to both players. Player 1 appears to favor 'rock', while Player 2 tends to use 'scissors' more frequently. Given these patterns, it might be strategic to play 'rock' to counter Player 1's likely continued use of 'rock' and to avoid the strong likelihood of being beaten by Player 2's 'scissors'.

Let's go with 'rock'.

Based on the previous rounds, it seems that "scissors" has been my consistent choice, but I've been tied and beaten by "rock." Since "rock" has been dominating the matches, I'll go with "paper" this time to potentially counter it.

My action is: **paper**.

Based on the outcomes of the last five rounds, it seems that both players are frequently choosing 'rock' and 'scissors'. I have consistently lost with my previous choices, particularly 'scissors'.

If players tend to favor 'rock', a safe choice would be to play 'paper', which would give me a chance against both players.

I will choose: **paper**.

You've been consistently tying with both players by sticking with scissors. Time for a change to break the pattern and catch them off guard!

I'll go with rock this time.

Based on the patterns of the last five rounds, I consistently played scissors, and both opponents played scissors and rock, leading to my losses. Since a common strategy in this game might be for opponents to continue using rock and scissors due to my repeated play of scissors, a reasonable choice would be to play paper to counter rock and potentially win against player 2 if they stick with their previous strategy.

Therefore, my action will be: **paper**.
